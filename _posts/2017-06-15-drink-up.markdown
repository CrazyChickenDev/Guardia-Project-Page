The water crisis is used by the United Nations and other international organizations to refer to the situation of world-wide water resources relative to human needs since 1970. The main source of crisis is the scarcity of available water.

`Drink Up` can quantify the amount of water in the bottle, in order to save every drop of water and drink it up!
